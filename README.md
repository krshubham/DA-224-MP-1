## Coding guidelines:

1. All code has to be checked into corresponding folders
2. ```main.py``` should be the entrypoint for the project. Meaning this program should be able to take different
   arguments in order to demonstrate different results
3. Since this is also a project, we can have a final ```end-to-end-demo.ipynb``` that will contain the final code to be
   shown as part of the demo
4. Do any work in notebooks only for exploration purposes. Only things that are final for demo purposes should be put in
   the ```end-to-end-demo.ipynb``` file
5. Work in separate branches. The merges for notebooks will happen using a special tool called *ReviewNB*. I have
   already integrated it with our project!
6. Let's get this done!
